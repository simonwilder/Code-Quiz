# Code-Quiz

Goal was to create a coding quiz using JavaScript and current Web API tools. The user is shown a series of questions, giving them four options. If the correct choice is made, they'll be notified on the next questions, same as if they answer the question incorrectly. If a question is answered incorrectly the user loses ten seconds off of their timer (which also functions as the final score), with the quiz ending after each question has been answered and/or the time has run out. They then have the ability to check their previous scores as well as refresh and take the quiz again.
